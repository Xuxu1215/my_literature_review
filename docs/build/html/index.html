<h1>How to Read a Paper<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-read-a-paper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

<p><strong>First pass:</strong></p>
<p>The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper. You can also decide whether you need to do anymore passes.</p>
<p>This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction</p></li>
<li><p>Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else</p></li>
<li><p>Glance at the mathematical content (if any) to determine the underlying theoretical foundations</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After the first pass, trying to answer below questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Category: the type of the paper (measurement, analysis of existing work, survey or introduce new algorithm)</p></li>
<li><p>Context: is there any other related work? Or, what is the theoretical background</p></li>
<li><p>Correctness</p></li>
<li><p>Contribution</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second Pass:</strong></p>
<p>In the second pass, read the paper with greater care, but ignore details such as proofs. It helps to jot down the keypoints, or to make comments in the margins, as you read. Also it is good to note down terms you didn’t understand, or questions you may want to ask the author.</p>
<p>The second pass should take up to an hour for an experienced reader. After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else. This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not lie in your research speciality.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the end of this section, try to answer three main questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What does it do?</p></li>
<li><p>How does it do it? (method detail)</p></li>
<li><p>What did it find? (model evaluation, experiment comparison, and results)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third Pass:</strong></p>
<p>At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Weaknesses: implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Strengths: presentation technique, support for conclusion, and internal efficacy</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doing A Literature Survey</strong></p>
<p>What papers should you read? The three-pass approach could also help:</p>
<p>First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent highly-cited papers in the area. Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections. You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper. If you can find such a survey, you are done.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These are the key papers and researchers in that area. Download the key papers and set them aside. Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they’ve published recently. That will help you identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.</p>
<p>The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings. A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey. Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.</p>
